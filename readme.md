## python_project
A template setup for a python project.

It contains the following:
* Setting up a python package
* unittest for testing the project libraries
* TravisCI for continuous integration
* Documentation on readthedocs.org built using Sphinx, Doxygen and breathe.
* Packaging the library for distribution on PyPi

The template documentation for this project is on [readthedocs](https://python-project-setup.readthedocs.io/en/latest/).

### Usage
- Clone this project:
```
git clone https://github.com/wasimusu/python_project.git
```
- Delete *lib.py files in python_project. This is where you will write your libraries
- Delete *.py files in tests dir. Add your own tests here.
- Replace python_project with your project name

### Platform
* Linux (Xenial/Ubuntu 18.04)
* Python 3.5, 3.7

### Generating Documentation
```
cd docs
doxygen -g Doxyfile
```
Now change some things in the Doxyfile that you have just generated.
- PROJECT_NAME = "python_project"
- GENERATE_LATEX         = NO
```
doxygen Doxyfile
sphinx-quickstart

```
Then you'll get some prompts.
```
> Separate source and build directories (y/n) [n]: y
> Project name: python_project
> Author name(s): Wasim Akram Khan
> Project release []: 0.0.1
> Project language [en]:
```

You can see there are four files insides docs/source generated by sphinx: _static, _templates, conf.py, index.rst

The conf.py file defines how your source files are documented. You need to add the path of
your package so that its files are reachable from conf.py.

Path of my conf.py: docs/source/conf.py

Add these two statements so conf.py can access your package.
```
import os
import sys
sys.path.insert(0, os.path.abspath('../..'))
sys.path.insert(0, os.path.abspath('../..'))
```

Extension tell doc generator what kind of stuffs to document and what not.
For instance, sphinx.ext.viewcode provides link to the code code. Add the following to conf.py

```
# First two are essential to generate the docs, others are optional.
extensions = [
    'sphinx.ext.autodoc',
    'sphinx.ext.viewcode',
    'sphinx.ext.doctest',
    'sphinx.ext.intersphinx',
    'sphinx.ext.todo',
    'sphinx.ext.ifconfig',
    'sphinx.ext.githubpages',
]
```

We're done with the configuration. See the source code for [conf.py](docs/source/conf.py). I have done away with the boilerplate stuff and


docs/source/index.rst file is like the readme for the documentation. The changes you make to this file
is seen in your documentation. In this file you define which python source file to document and which not to.
You can include installation instructions, features, usage code snippets, etc in this file.

We built two libraries in this project: mathlib and strlib. We want both to be documented.
So let's add that to the index.rst above "Indices and tables".

```
Math Lib
========
.. automodule:: python_project.mathlib
   :members:

String Lib
==========
.. automodule:: python_project.strlib
   :members:
```

View the source code for [index.rst](docs/source/index.rst). I have done away with the boilerplate stuff and
made the documentation more custom.

```
make html
```
We have now setup the documentation. Open the docs/build/html/index.html in your browser to view the documentation on localhost.

**If you're not seeing your source files indexed/documented then it's probably path error. Make sure your source files are discoverable.**
You can do this by testing different values for sys.path.insert()


To re-generate documentation locally each time you change the documentation:
```
cd docs
make clean
doxygen Doxyfile
make html
```
Open the docs/build/html/index.html in your browser to view the documentation on localhost.

#### Readthedocs
To generate documentation on readthedocs.org, do the following:
- Make an account on readthedocs.org if you have not already.
- On readthedocs.org, select your project for generating documentation and build.


### Run all tests
Discovers all the files named test*.py and runs all the unittest.
```
python -m unittest discover tests
```

### TravisCI (Continuous Integration)
Basically all you need is an account on travis-ci.com and link your github account. Whenever you push a project containing
.travis.yml file to github the TravisCI is triggered. It builds the projects, runs tests and/or benchmarks as defined in
the .travis.yml file.

Defining .travis.yml is simple. You only need to define what versions of Python you want to test and what platforms. You
also need to provide instructions on how to run your code just like you'd explain on your github readme to potential users.

### Packaging the python_project for distribution on pypi.org
MANIFEST.in and setup.py are files that define the packaging. If you've followed the structure of this project, you're setup
for distribution. Please refer to [this](https://medium.com/@joel.barmettler/how-to-upload-your-python-package-to-pypi-65edc5fe9c56) to see the instructions to build your package and upload it to pypi.org.
